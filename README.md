# Common-Language Effect Size

The Common-Language Effect Size (CLES) is the probability that a sample from one group is greater than a sample from another group. It's used sometimes as the effect size accompanying a [Mannâ€“Whitney U test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test). If the two groups are positive and negative examples for a classifier, it's the same thing as [AUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic).

This is a Python implementation that calculates the exact (non-parametric) value. It enforces the strict inequality (no half-credit when equal).

```python
from cles import cles
cles([1, 2], [2, 3])
## 0.75
```
